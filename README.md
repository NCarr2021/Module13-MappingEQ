# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Module 13 Mapping Earthquake_Challenge

# Purpose

Create an interactive world map to display GeoJSON geographical and Tectonic 
Plate data to visualize earthquake data. Map center coordinates are 40.7, -94.5. 
The data overlays allow viewing of either all earthquakes, tectonic plates and major 
earthquakes or combinations with satellite, street or dark views. Varying sizes and 
colors indicate earthquakes and their magnitude with the largest, those measuring
greater than 5.0 in a red circle. Click on any circle to see eqrthquake magnitude
and location. The legend indicates colors used for the different magnitudes.
